❓ What is ``StewBeet``
---------------------------

``StewBeet`` is a `Beet <https://github.com/mcbeet/beet>`_ framework and library 📦 aiming to provide huge automation for creating Minecraft datapacks.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
It is designed to be very simple to use and very convenient for developers.

``Example of the in-game manual generated by StewBeet:``\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`

   :alt: In-game Manual Example


Here is a list of features that the package provides (the template is using all of them with clear comments):


* 🔄 Automatic resource pack files generation (models, textures, sounds, music discs) with the ability to override them with help of the ``assets`` folder.
* ⏳ Versioned load, and clock functions such as ``tick``\ , ``second``\ , ``minute``.
* 🗃️ Loot tables for every item in the ``definitions`` along with a proper ``_give_all`` function that gives named chests.
* 📖 Automatic generation of a really `advanced and interactive items ``manual`` <./assets/in_game_manual_example.png>`_.
* 📝 Automatic generation of a ``en-us.json`` lang file in the resource pack if configuration is set.
* 🖼️ Automatic headers for every function in ``function`` folders.
* 📦 Minecraft like vanilla recipes unlocking.
* 📚 Official libraries integrations:

  * 🧪 Automatic support for NBT Recipes with `\ ``Smithed Crafter`` <https://wiki.smithed.dev/libraries/crafter/>`_ and `\ ``Furnace NBT Recipes`` <https://github.com/Stoupy51/FurnaceNbtRecipes/>`_
  * 🛠️ Placement and destruction for every custom block in the ``definitions`` with support for blockstates, ore drops (fortune, silk touch), with `\ ``Smithed Custom Blocks`` <https://wiki.smithed.dev/libraries/custom-block/>`_.
  * 📚 Each module from `\ ``Bookshelf`` <https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf>`_ is automatically added if you are using it, ex: ``function #bs.math:...`` will add the ``bs.math`` module to the datapack.
  * ⛏️ Custom ore generation with `\ ``Smart Ore Generation`` <https://github.com/Stoupy51/SmartOreGeneration>`_.
  * 📦 Item transportation / container declaration with `\ ``ItemIO`` <https://github.com/edayot/ItemIO>`_ when making custom containers.
  * 🔔 Events such as new items detection with `\ ``Common Signals`` <https://github.com/Stoupy51/CommonSignals>`_.

* 🌐 External datapack libraries support, see configuration for more information.
* 🔗 Merging datapacks and resource packs with libraries using `Smithed Weld <https://weld.smithed.dev/>`_.
* 🧩 Automatic recognition of custom blocks patterns depending on the texture names in the ``assets/textures`` folder. For instance, if you have a top, side, and bottom texture, the block will be automatically recognized as a cube with the top, side, and bottom textures.
* 📏 Follow the datapack conventions such as `LanternLoad <https://github.com/LanternMC/load>`_\ , `CustomModelData prefix <https://mcdatapack.vercel.app/>`_\ , `tag specification <https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/tag-specification/>`_\ , and `namespacing <https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/namespacing/>`_.
* 🧰 Ability to merge a model with the autogenerated one or override it.
* 🔀 ``merge`` folder providing a way to merge custom files with the autogenerated ones or add custom files to the datapack.
* ⚙️ Automatic special compatibilities with datapacks such as `\ ``SimpleDrawer's compacted drawer`` <https://edayot.github.io/SimpleDrawer/material.html>`_\ , `\ ``SimplEnergy's pulverizer`` <./build/datapack/data/your_namespace/function/calls/simplenergy/pulverizer_recipes.mcfunction>`_.
* 📂 Automatic copy of generated zip files to configured folders.

📦 How to use (beginner friendly)
---------------------------------

In order to use ``StewBeet``\ , you need to have at least `Python 3.12 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ 🐍 or higher installed on your computer with pip!\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
Then, you can open a terminal 💻 and run the following command to install the python package:

.. code-block:: bash

   # This will install the latest version of the framework
   # (including beet, bolt, mecha, and other dependencies)
   pip install stewbeet

Next, there are a few templates available in the `\ ``./templates`` <./templates/>`_ folder 📁,\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
There are 3 templates available, feel free to choose the one you prefer (but I highly recommend the basic template):


* 🔹 `\ ``minimal template`` <./templates/minimal_template.zip>`_\ : A very minimal template using only one ``stewbeet`` plugin.
* ⭐ `\ ``basic template`` <./templates/basic_template.zip>`_\ : A template with complete configuration but no coded features.
* 🌟 `\ ``extensive template`` <./templates/extensive_template.zip>`_\ : A template with all the features of the framework, including all the plugins.

The clickable links are zip files 📦, but you can check the content of the templates in the `\ ``./templates`` <./templates/>`_ folder.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`

Once you have a template, you can modify the ``beet.yml`` configuration file ⚙️ to suit your needs.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
Finally, you can run the following command to build the project 🔨:

.. code-block:: bash

   # You can also run 'beet' instead of 'stewbeet' but with less functionality
   # (Make sure you are in the project folder)
   stewbeet

The command will generate a datapack and a resource pack in your ``build`` folder 🏗️.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
And that's it! 🎉 That is this easy use the package.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
Since this template is using all the features of the package, you can remove the parts you don't need! 🧹

🌱 How to use (Beet users)
